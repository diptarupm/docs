# Getting started with IBM IoT for Automotive (Experimental)
{: #getting_started_iotautomotive}

{{site.data.keyword.iot4auto_full}} is a {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service that links drivers and vehicles to the surrounding environment to improve the mobility experience. You can use the {{site.data.keyword.iot4auto_short}} service to retrieve, manage, and analyze car probe data from connected vehicles and use the data to build smart automotive solutions that optimize fleet operations. {{site.data.keyword.iot4auto_short}} can provide intelligent and actionable insights into driving behavior, vehicle location, and other automotive-related activities and events of interest.

{:shortdesc}

By using {{site.data.keyword.iot4auto_short}}, you can do the following tasks:

- Send car probe data and normalized data into the data store for analysis
- Inject events into the context map and retrieve the events that affect specific vehicles
- Identify new events from car probe data
- Retrieve information about connected vehicles
- Manage asset data for drivers, vehicles, event rules, event types, and vendors
- Understand driving behavior and diagnose potential safety or quality issues


## Components
{: #components}

{{site.data.keyword.iot4auto_short}} provides a vehicle data hub, which collects and manages large volumes of data from vehicles and automotive devices by using a range of protocols and formats. {{site.data.keyword.iot4auto_short}} also provides the following automotive services, which are also separately available for you to deploy in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog:

|Service|Description|
|:---|:---|
|[Driver Behavior](../IotDriverInsights/index.html){:new_window}| A service that can analyze driver behavior and identify trajectory patterns of a journey from the car probe and context data that is retrieved from a connected vehicle.
|[Context Mapping](../IotMapInsights/index.html){:new_window}| A service that provides geospatial functions, such as map matching and shortest path search for road networks.

## Preparing to deploy
{: #preparing}

Before you begin to integrate your automotive devices and applications with the {{site.data.keyword.iot4auto_short}} service, ensure that you complete the following steps:

1. Review the [About {{site.data.keyword.iot4auto_short}}](iotautomotive_overview.html) topic to familiarize yourself with the features and analytics that are available and supported for the service.
2. When you add an instance of the service from the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/labs/){:new_window}, ensure that it is not bound to an app and that you make a note of the automatically generated tenant ID, user name, and password values. You need these values later to access the service by using the {{site.data.keyword.iot4auto_short}} API.
3. Using the console on the dashboard, configure the ports, target host names, and other settings for your {{site.data.keyword.iot4auto_short}} instance. For more information, see [Administering](iotautomotive_admin.html).

## Deploying and integrating with the REST API
{: #deploying}

{{site.data.keyword.iot4auto_short}} provides automotive domain specialized application development enablers for data acquisition, storage, real-time processing, and business rules support. Use the available APIs to retrieve map context, movement, driver behavior, health of vehicles, and analytic insights data.

You can integrate your automotive devices and applications with this service by using REST API commands from the available  {{site.data.keyword.iot4auto_short}} APIs. For more detailed information, see [APIs](iotautomotive_apis.html).

To get up and running quickly, complete the following steps:

1. Inject events by using the `sendEvent` API request command to send events to be analyzed.
  - Request: event data with position
2. Confirm that the event data is stored with Map Matching by using the `getEvent` API request command to retrieve the event.
  - Request: area data (longitude and latitude of the start or end points)
  - Response: event data with road link ID
3.  Send car probe data to be analyzed by using the `sendCarProbe` API request command.
  - Request: car probe data with position
4. Confirm that the car probe data is stored with Map Matching by using the `getCarProbe` API request command to retrieve the data.
  - Request: area data (longitude and latitude of the start or end points)
  - Response: car probe data with road link ID
5. Analyze the driver data. For more information, see [Driver Behavior](../IotDriverInsights/index.html){:new_window}.
